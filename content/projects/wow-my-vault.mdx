## Why?
I wanted to check my vault reward progress without logging in to see if I should log in to finish filling my vault

## How?
A small NextJS app integrated with the RaiderIO API that allows me or others to look up the vault reward progress by character.

#### Limitations
Currently only displaying m+ progress. At the moment I only care to see my m+ reward progress, but in the future I might expand to see raid progress.
